####Where do you place your trust?

We don't have time to understand everything about computers, so we often hand the power over to our IT people, vendors, or consultants. Giving authority to others blindly is a dangerous and costly strategy - but what else can you do?

 - Learn to ask the right questions
 - Require communication you can comprehend
 - Require proof (initial and ongoing)
 - Use outside experts to evaluate your inside experts

####Network Security Concepts

 - Monitor the right things
 - Deny access by default
 - Allow access only to required services
 - Training for you and your people

####Computer Disaster Recovery

 - Monitor the right things
 - Design systems from the start for replacement
 - Multi-site redundancy
 - Multi-vendor cloud redundancy
 - Don't take their word for it
 - See the failover testing actually work
 - Let your people know this is a top priority
 - Training for you and your people

####Leverage Community Intelligence

Stay up to date and give your employees time to read high quality updates on computer security issues. Attend or host regular presentations that will enhance your understanding of threats and countermeasures. Keep the choice of material relevant to your type of business.
